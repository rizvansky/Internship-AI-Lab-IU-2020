***Description of the work:*** *Evaluate the generalization performance of a specific model in 
Pneumonia detection when trained and tested on datasets from various institutions that were 
annotated by different clinicians or labeling tools.*


**Week 1:**
Learn PyTorch framework basics, write and train the neural network on some dataset for 
the image classification.

**Week 2:**
Start working with X-Ray images, train the convolutional neural network on the dataset with 
X-Ray images.

**Week 3:**
Preprocess images from datasets from the server. Inspect the data, choose the needed transforms 
for these datasets.

**Week 4:**
Train neural network on all datasets, evaluate the performance, create the .pdf report about 
the work conducted.
